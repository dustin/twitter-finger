# Twitter Finger

I saw [any.io](http://any.io)'s finger service and it looked awesome,
but there was no source code so I figured I'd write one while sitting
around.

I did this in twisted because it was way easy and figured there was a
need for a thousand or so concurrent finger requests to be handled at
any given point in time.
